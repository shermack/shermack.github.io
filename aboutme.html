        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I began my programming journey independently, starting with Python. This initial step led me to back-end web development, where I explored databases and servers. My fascination with these areas sparked a profound interest in cybersecurity. I found great enjoyment in writing scrapers and manipulating databases, which further fueled my passion for the field.
            <br><br>
            As I delved deeper into cybersecurity, I adopted Kali Linux as my primary operating system. Utilizing its robust tools, I also developed advanced ones in Python. My journey reflects a dedication to self-driven learning and highlights the exciting intersection of web development and cybersecurity.
